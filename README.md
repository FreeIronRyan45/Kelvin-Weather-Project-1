# Kelvin-Weather-Project-1
Copy of a Project I did For My Javascript Course Recent Which is For Kelvin (temperature)
In this project, I had convert temperature Kelvin to Celsius, then to Fehrenheit.

Instructions:
1. Create variable named Kelvin and set it to equal any number.
2. Write a comment above that explain this change of code.
3. Convert Kelvin to Celsius by subtracting from the kelvin variable. Store what is shown in another variable.
4. Write comment above that explains the change.
5. Use equation to calculate Fahrenheit then s tore the answer in a variable named Fahrenheit: Fahrenheit = celsius * () + a (a is number)
6. WRite comment above that explains the change.
7. Use the .floor() method from the Math library to round the Fahrenheit. Save result to the Fahrenheit variable: fahrenheit = Math.floor(fahrenheit);
8. Write comment abolve that explains the code: Round down fahrenheit variable
9. Use console.log and string interpolation to log the temperature in fahrenheit to the console in fahrenheit to the console as: The Temperature is TEMPERATURE degrees Fahrenheit. Use string interpolation to replace TEMPERATURE with the value saved to fahrenheit.
10. Run the program.
11. Determine what 0 kelvin in fahrenheit and for extra practice, try to convert celsius to the Newton scale using this equation: Newton = Celsius * () and then round down the Newton temperature using the .floor() method and use console.log and string interpolation to log the temperature in newton to the console.
